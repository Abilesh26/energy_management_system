The current state of energy management lacks a comprehensive solution for real-time monitoring, theft detection, and demand prediction. 

Existing systems struggle to integrate diverse data sources and provide actionable insights for efficient resource planning. 

Energy theft further poses a significant challenge, requiring robust algorithms to identify anomalies in consumption patterns. The absence of a unified platform for secure data compilation and user-friendly visualization hampers effective decision-making. 

Thus, there is a critical need for an integrated energy management system that addresses these challenges, offering a holistic approach to monitoring, prediction, and theft detection while ensuring data integrity and user accessibility.

Real-Time Monitoring: AC sensors track energy usage in real-time, generating data for analysis and management.
Precise Demand Prediction: LSTM neural networks forecast energy demand accurately, aiding in proactive resource planning.
Theft Detection: SVM algorithms identify energy theft by distinguishing normal usage from suspicious patterns.
Data Integrity: Information is securely uploaded to ThingSpeak, ensuring reliability and accessibility.
User Engagement: A user-friendly web app visualizes energy usage and alerts, empowering informed decisions and combating theft.
